# KlipperScreen

KlipperScreen is a touchscreen GUI that interfaces with [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) via [Moonraker](https://github.com/arksine/moonraker). It allows you to switch between multiple printers and access them from a single location. Notably, it doesn't need to run on the same host as your printer; you can install it on another device and configure the IP address to connect to the printer.

### Inspiration

KlipperScreen draws inspiration from [OctoScreen](https://github.com/Z-Bolt/OctoScreen/) and was developed to provide a native touchscreen GUI compatible with [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) and [Moonraker](https://github.com/arksine/moonraker).
