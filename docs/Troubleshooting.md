# Troubleshooting

## First Steps

The first step to troubleshooting any problem is getting the cause of the error.

* Find KlipperScreen.log:

!!! warning "Important"
    This log file should be provided if you ask for support.

Depending on your setup the file could be accessible from the web interface alongside other logs

|                        Mainsail                         |                       Fluidd                        |
|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
| ![mainsail_logs](img/troubleshooting/logs_mainsail.png) | ![fluidd_logs](img/troubleshooting/logs_fluidd.png) |

if you can't find it in the web interface, you will need to grab the system logs as explained below

??? tip "Alternative: Using sftp to grab the logs"
    It is possible to use sftp to grab the log, with an application like Filezilla or WinSCP

    With some file-browsers like Dolphin, just type the address for example: `sftp://pi@192.168.1.105/home/`

    Locate the logs at `~/printer_data/logs`or in `/tmp/` if the former doesn't exist.

## System logs

If [KlipperScreen.log](#first-steps) doesn't exist open a terminal in the host (typically from SSH) and
run this commands:

??? info "Multiple printers on the same host"
    If the host is running multiple printers you may need to change `printer_data` to `printer_1_data`

```sh
systemctl status KlipperScreen > ~/printer_data/logs/KlipperScreen_systemctl.log
journalctl -xe -u KlipperScreen > ~/printer_data/logs/KlipperScreen_journalctl.log
cp /var/log/Xorg.0.log ~/printer_data/logs/KlipperScreen_Xorg.log
cp -n /tmp/KlipperScreen.log ~/printer_data/logs/KlipperScreen.log
```

This will copy all the relevant logs to the folder described above, so they can be downloaded from the browser.
With the method described in the first section. You may need to press refresh or reload the page


??? tip "Alternative: inspect them directly on the terminal:"
    !!! warning
        Please do not copy-paste the output of the terminal when providing info for an issue,
        most of the time this output will be incomplete, use the method described above
    ```sh
    systemctl status KlipperScreen
    journalctl -xe -u KlipperScreen
    cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log
    ```


## Screen shows console instead of KlipperScreen

    This is usually not the main cause of the error. [Start by checking the screen](Troubleshooting/Physical_Install.md)

    Drivers not installed or misconfigured can cause this too, continue looking the logs for more clues.

    This error is common on RaspberryOS when using FBturbo, it's not a related issue.

    This has been known to happen on RaspberryOS Bookworm Lite on Pi5

    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-vc4.conf
    ```
    paste this into the file:
    ```
    Section "OutputClass"
      Identifier "vc4"
      MatchDriver "vc4"
      Driver "modesetting"
      Option "PrimaryGPU" "true"
    EndSection
    ```
    reboot


[Maybe it's the wrong framebuffer](Troubleshooting/Framebuffer.md)

## Screen is always ***white*** / ***black*** or ***`No signal`***

If the screen never shows the console even during startup, Then it's typically an improperly installed screen.

[Follow this steps](Troubleshooting/Physical_Install.md)


## The screen shows colors or 'No signal' when idle

In KliperScreen settings find 'Screen DPMS' and turn it off.

![dpms](img/troubleshooting/dpms.gif)

Your screen doesn't seem to support turning off via software.

KlipperScreen will enable an internal screensaver to make it all black, and hopefully avoid burn-in.
If you find a way of turning it off, please share it: [Contact](Contact.md)
