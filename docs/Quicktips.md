### Hide macros, outputs or fans

As you probably already noticed, you can show and hide the gcode macros in the interface settings, but there is moreâ€¦

Did you know, that you can also hide gcode macros by prefixing the name with an underscore?

```
[gcode_macro MY_AWESOME_GCODE]
gcode:
    _MY_HELPER_CODE
[gcode_macro _MY_HELPER_CODE]
gcode:
    M300
```

MY_AWESOME_GCODE appears in your interface settings, _MY_HELPER_CODE not.

Another example:

Lets hide a temperature_fan:

```
[temperature_fan fan1]
[temperature_fan _fan2]
```

fan1 will show in the interface, but _fan2 will be hidden.
